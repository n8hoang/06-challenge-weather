# 06 Weather App

## Description

This weather application will allow you to search any city and get a five day forecast including wind speed, temperature, and humidity. There will also be an icon that shows up representing the weather. Additionally every search is saved into a button so you can later access those cities' weather info. For this project I used the CSS framwork Bulma and actually found that I like it. Also I feel that this project really helped me lock in my API skills. I feel very comfortable calling APIs and displaying their data on my page.

## Installation

No need to install just run in browser. Link to deployed APP : https://n8hoang.github.io/06-challenge-weather

## Usage

Search a city and get a 5 day weather forecast. Each searched city will be saved as a button so you can later access that weather data at a later time.
